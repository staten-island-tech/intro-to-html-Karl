    <h1>Boop world</h1>
    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Karl, and I am a Junior at Staten Island Tech. Here I am, taking multiple courses that challenge me in many ways.
        I play the piano and I used to play the trumpet.
        Some of my favorite classes are CAD and physics. We will see if this year, CS also becomes my favoite. Maybe it can. If i enjoy this year, then thats good enough. 
     </p>
